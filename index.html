        <p id="writeUp">
          My name is Eniola Kuranga, I am a final year student in the University
          of Lagos Nigeria studying Linguistics African and Asian studies.
          Besides the course i am studying, I am also a tech savvy individual. I
          am also a frontend web developer. Prior to my admission in unilag, i
          was also a student of the Aptech computer education institute. I have
          been exposed to many different programming languages including C,
          HTML, PYTHON, JAVA, REACT, DJANGO and CSS. I have many aspirations in
          the tech space, I have always had immense interest in the space and i
          wish to go as far as i could possibly go in it because of this I have
          enrolled in many bootcamps/internships including the one i am
          currently enrolled in (HNG). I have alot of goals but I will like to
          share my most important ones for the next two years.
